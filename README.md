# Projectile Rails [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/asok/projectile-rails.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asok/projectile-rails)

## Synopsis

**Projectile Rails** is a minor mode for working with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) applications and engines in GNU Emacs.
Internally it is based on [Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile).

It means that you can use Projectile's commands for greping (or acking) files, run tests, switch between projects, etc.

With Projectile Rails you are able to:

* navigate through rails resources (controllers, views, helpers and so on)
* jump to ruby classes and template files
* run `rake`
* run `rails console`
* run `rails dbconsole`
* run `rails generate`
* run `rails server`
* open log files with `auto-revert-mode` on
* see rails keywords highlighted
* take advantage of [zeus](https://github.com/burke/zeus) and [spring](https://github.com/jonleighton/spring) preloaders

It can be a replacement for [rinari](https://github.com/eschulte/rinari).

## Setup

### Installation

#### Melpa

Once you have setup [Melpa](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started) you can use `package-install` command to install Projectile Rails. The package name is `projectile-rails`.

#### el-get

The package name for [el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get) is `projectile-rails`.

## Usage

### The global mode

Use the package as a global mode:

```el
(projectile-rails-global-mode)
```

That will turn on the local `projectile-rails-mode` for the buffers which belong to a Rails project (either application or an engine).

Probably you should read Projectile's [README](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) on setting up the completion system, caching and indexing files. Although the default settings are quite sensible and you should be ready to go without much tweaking.

### Customizing

#### Keymap prefix
Prior to version 0.20.0 the keymap prefix used to be setup. Following the [convention](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Key-Binding-Conventions.html) we have stopped doing this automatically.
Now you need to attach the mode's map to the desired key yourself.
For example to get the old key you can do:
```el
(define-key projectile-rails-mode-map (kbd "C-c r") 'projectile-rails-command-map)
```

#### Keywords

The mode's buffers will have the Rails keywords highlighted. To turn it off:
```el
(setq projectile-rails-add-keywords nil)
```

#### Snippets

If you have [yas-minor-mode or yas-global-mode](https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet) enabled and you open a new file it will be filled with a skeleton class. To turn it off:
```el
(setq projectile-rails-expand-snippet nil)
```

#### ANSI Colors

By default the buffer of the `projectile-rails-server-mode` is applying the ansi colors. If you find it slow you can disable it with:
```el
(setq projectile-rails-server-mode-ansi-colors nil)
```

#### External commands

You can customize the way the `rails`, `spring` and `zeus` commands are invoked. For example if you want to use binstubs:

```el
(setq projectile-rails-vanilla-command "bin/rails"
      projectile-rails-spring-command "bin/spring"
      projectile-rails-zeus-command "bin/zeus")
```

### Interactive commands

The keymap is unbound by default. The following keybinding assume that you've bound it to `C-c r`. See [Keymap prefix](#keymap-prefix) section for details.

You might want to create your own keybinding for your favorite commands. For example:

```el
(define-key projectile-rails-mode-map (kbd "s-m")   'projectile-rails-find-model)
(define-key projectile-rails-mode-map (kbd "s-c")   'projectile-rails-find-controller)
(define-key projectile-rails-mode-map (kbd "s-v")   'projectile-rails-find-view)
(define-key projectile-rails-mode-map (kbd "s-RET") 'projectile-rails-goto-file-at-point)
(define-key projectile-rails-mode-map (kbd "C-c g")  projectile-rails-mode-goto-map)
```

### Discover

There's also integration with [discover.el](https://github.com/mickeynp/discover.el). The key that trigger the menu is `s-r` (the "s" stands for Win/Command key).

![Screenshot](https://github.com/asok/projectile-rails/raw/master/screenshots/discover.png)

### Hydra

There's also integration with [hydra](https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra).
The name of the hydra `hydra-projectile-rails`. In order to bind it you can something like this:

```el
(define-key projectile-rails-mode-map (kbd "s-r") 'hydra-projectile-rails/body)
```

## Beyond

Consider installing other Emacs packages that can help you working specifically with Rails projects.

### Templates

Extension   | Alternatives
------------|------------------------------------------------------
 erb        | [web-mode](https://github.com/fxbois/web-mode), [mmm-mode](https://github.com/purcell/mmm-mode), [rhtml-mode](https://github.com/eschulte/rhtml)
 haml		| [haml-mode](https://github.com/nex3/haml-mode)
 slim		| [emacs-slim](https://github.com/slim-template/emacs-slim)
 yaml		| [yaml-mode](https://github.com/yoshiki/yaml-mode)

### Running ruby gems

Some of the Projectile Rails functions run `rake` or `rails` executables. If you are using a ruby version manager you might need to configure your Emacs to play nicely with it.

* [rvm.el](https://github.com/senny/rvm.el)
* [rbenv.el](https://github.com/senny/rbenv.el)
* [chruby.el](https://github.com/plexus/chruby.el)

OS X users might want to look at [exec-path-from-shell](https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell).

### Miscellaneous

* [bundler.el](https://github.com/tobiassvn/bundler.el) to interact with Bundler.
* [rspec-mode](https://github.com/pezra/rspec-mode) to run and edit spec files.
* [ruby-test-mode](https://github.com/r0man/ruby-test-mode) to run and edit test files.
* [feature-mode](https://github.com/michaelklishin/cucumber.el) to edit feature files.
* [robe](https://github.com/dgutov/robe) to view gems documentation and jump to methods and classes definitions.
* [magit](https://github.com/magit/magit) to interact with git.

## Caveat

### Running pry instead of irb
* Pry's paging is not working in emacs. It should be disabled with `Pry.config.pager = false if ENV["INSIDE_EMACS"]`. [Reference](https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki/Customization-and-configuration#wiki-pager).

* When `projectile-rails-console` runs rails console using a pre-loader (zeus or spring) and pry's indent correction is enabled then pry will insert some ansi codes that are misinterpreted by `comint-mode`. A workaround is to disable the indentation correction with `Pry.config.correct_indent = false`. [Reference](https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki/Customization-and-configuration#wiki-correct-indent). [Issue](https://github.com/asok/projectile-rails/issues/12).

### Debugging

To use `binding.pry` or `byebug`, install `inf-ruby` and add this to
your init file:

```el
(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'inf-ruby-switch-setup)
```

## Contributors

Here's a [list](https://github.com/asok/projectile-rails/graphs/contributors) of the people that contributed to the projects. Many thanks! :)

## Contribution

Install [cask](https://github.com/rejeep/cask.el) if you haven't already, then:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/projectile-rails
$ cask
```

Run all tests with:

```bash
$ make test
```

For all of them to pass you will need the `bundle` executable in your path.
